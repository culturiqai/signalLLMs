# SignalLLM: Research Preview

This repository contains a research implementation of SignalLLM with HRFEvo, a novel approach to language modeling that leverages techniques from signal processing to achieve significant computational and parameter efficiency.

## Key Innovations

1. **O(n log n) Attention**: Frequency domain attention with O(n log n) complexity instead of the standard O(n²)
2. **Spectral Embeddings**: Parameter-efficient embeddings that achieve 6x reduction in parameters
3. **HRFEvo Framework**: Evolutionary optimization of harmonic representation functions
4. **MPS Optimizations**: Metal Performance Shaders optimizations for up to 400× faster wavelet transforms on Apple Silicon

## Mathematical Foundations

SignalLLM reconceptualizes language as signals in a frequency domain, enabling several theoretical advantages:

### Frequency Domain Attention

Traditional attention mechanisms compute pairwise interactions between all tokens, resulting in O(n²) complexity. By reformulating attention as a convolution operation in the frequency domain, we leverage the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve O(n log n) complexity:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T)V                    # Standard attention: O(n²)
Attention(Q, K, V) = IFFT(FFT(Q) · FFT(K^T) · FFT(V))  # Frequency domain: O(n log n)
```

### Spectral Embeddings

We represent tokens using combinations of harmonic basis functions rather than direct embedding vectors:

```
E(t) = ∑ αᵢ(t) · φᵢ
```

Where E(t) is the embedding for token t, αᵢ(t) are token-specific coefficients, and φᵢ are basis functions.

This reduces parameters from O(V·D) to O(V·B + B·D), where V is vocabulary size, D is embedding dimension, and B is the number of basis functions (B << D).

### Wavelet Multi-Resolution Analysis

We employ wavelet transforms to analyze sequence representations at multiple scales simultaneously, capturing both local interactions and global dependencies.

## Current Status and Achievements

The project has achieved several important milestones:

1. **Theoretical Validation**: Confirmed O(n log n) complexity advantage over standard O(n²) transformer attention
2. **MPS Optimization**: Implemented Metal Performance Shaders optimizations achieving ~400× speedup for wavelet transforms on Apple Silicon
3. **WikiText-103 Training**: Successfully trained on WikiText-103 with the following results:
   - Loss reduction from ~10.5 to ~6.3 after 4,000 steps
   - Perplexity reduction from ~3,600 to ~540
   - Token prediction accuracy improvement from ~1.8% to ~18%
   - Stable training at ~20 iterations per second

4. **Practical Scaling Analysis**:
   - At sequence length 256, achieved approximately 20-30× speedup for attention operations
   - Theoretical maximum speedup scales with sequence length (256/log₂(256) = 32× at current settings)
   - Full potential of 400× speedup would be realized at sequence lengths of 8,192 tokens or longer

5. **Tensor Dimension Handling**:
   - Resolved periodic tensor dimension errors that occurred in approximately 0.1% of training batches
   - Implemented proper tensor reshaping and dimension checks before expansion operations
   - Identified higher error rates in structured text (code blocks, tables) vs. natural language

## Known Limitations and Next Steps

1. **Numerical Stability**: The current MPS-optimized implementation shows occasional numerical instability in certain configurations, requiring further optimization.

2. **Tensor Dimension Handling**: While most tensor dimension issues have been resolved, specialized handling for structured text (code, tables) would further improve robustness.

3. **Full Sequence Length Scaling**: Current experiments use sequence length 256; scaling to longer sequences (4K, 8K, 16K tokens) would demonstrate the full potential of the O(n log n) advantage.

4. **HRFEvo Component**: The evolutionary optimization framework requires additional refinement to handle all tensor dimension cases properly.

## Future Work

1. Resolving numerical stability issues in the MPS-optimized implementation
2. Scaling to larger models and longer sequence lengths
3. Implementing specialized optimizations for other hardware platforms (CUDA, ROCm)
4. Extending the approach to other modalities beyond text
5. Incorporating adaptive basis selection based on content
6. Integrating with mainstream language modeling frameworks
