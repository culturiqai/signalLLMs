# MPS Optimizations for SignalLLM with HRFEvo

This document describes the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) optimizations implemented for SignalLLM to significantly accelerate performance on Apple Silicon hardware.

## Overview

The wavelet transform operations are computationally intensive and can become bottlenecks, especially for longer sequences. Our optimized implementation leverages the MPS backend for Apple Silicon to achieve dramatic speedups:

- **~400x faster** wavelet transforms compared to the standard implementation
- Properly sized coefficients for better numerical stability
- Consistent sequence length maintenance between input and output
- Improved device handling to keep tensors on the MPS device

## Key Optimizations

1. **Optimized Convolution Operations**
   - Custom `_conv1d_mps` implementation specifically for Metal
   - Direct convolution rather than relying on PyWavelets library

2. **Consistent Coefficient Shapes**
   - Calculate and enforce proper coefficient sizes at each level
   - Fix shape mismatches with interpolation and padding 
   - Store original sequence length for exact reconstruction

3. **Device Handling**
   - Proper `detach()` before CPU transfers
   - Ensured tensors stay on MPS device throughout processing
   - Better device inference for models without parameters

4. **Numerical Stability**
   - Properly configured padding for wavelets
   - Improved coefficient initialization
   - Support for different wavelet types

## Performance Results

| Sequence Length | Standard (ms) | MPS Optimized (ms) | Speedup |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 64             | 490.70       | 1.35              | 364.46x |
| 128            | 489.28       | 1.19              | 410.58x |
| 256            | 495.28       | 1.19              | 417.04x |
| 512            | 496.58       | 1.22              | 406.13x |
| 1024           | 493.03       | 1.25              | 395.97x |

## Visualizations

The optimized implementation maintains accurate signal reconstruction with low error rates:

- Wavelet decomposition visualization available in `./benchmarks/wavelet_visualization_*.png`
- Error measurements for different sequence lengths in `./benchmarks/wavelet_reconstruction_errors.png`
- Implementation comparison in `./benchmarks/mps_implementation_comparison.png`
- Speedup visualization in `./benchmarks/mps_wavelet_speedup.png`

## Usage

To use the MPS-optimized implementation:

```python
from mps_optimizations import setup_mps_optimizations, optimize_for_mps

# Setup MPS optimizations
setup_mps_optimizations()

# Create your model
model = SignalLLM(config)

# Apply MPS optimizations
device = torch.device("mps")
model = optimize_for_mps(model, device=device)
```

The `optimize_for_mps` function automatically replaces standard modules with MPS-optimized versions, including:

- `WaveletTransform` → `MPSWaveletTransform`
- `FourierConvolutionAttention` and `WaveletAttention` → `MPSOptimizedAttention`

## Next Steps

These optimizations provide a solid foundation for further training and evaluation, significantly reducing the computational bottleneck of wavelet transforms. The dramatic speedup enables:

1. Faster training on larger datasets
2. Experimentation with longer sequence lengths
3. More efficient hyperparameter optimization

Further optimizations could include attention mechanism improvements and tensor core utilization for even greater performance.
