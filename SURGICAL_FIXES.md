# SignalLLM Surgical Fixes

This document outlines critical fixes to the SignalLLM implementation to address the suspiciously low perplexity values observed in training.

## Problem Identification

The primary issue was that the WikiText-103 dataset implementation was *claiming* to use non-overlapping sequences, but the implementation was not working as intended. This led to:

1. Double counting of tokens in training data
2. ~460K steps per epoch instead of the expected ~230K
3. Artificially low perplexity metrics that didn't reflect true model performance

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed WikiText103Dataset Implementation

- Added proper stride control in the dataset implementation
- Added environment variable control to test with/without overlapping sequences
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose dataset construction issues
- Improved code documentation and clarity

### 2. Updated Training Script

- Created a separate output directory to differentiate new runs from old
- Added verification step to confirm dataset implementation is correct
- Added step count checks to validate expected training iterations
- Updated hyperparameters for more reproducible comparisons

### 3. Added Verification Tools

- Created `verify_perplexity.py` script to test perplexity calculations with known values
- Added a baseline GPT-2 Tiny model evaluation for comparison
- Implemented dataset overlap checker to detect potential data leakage issues

## Verification Steps

To ensure the fixes are working, run the following verification steps:

```bash
# Run the verification script to test perplexity calculation and baseline
python verify_perplexity.py --all --device mps

# Test just the baseline model with GPT-2 Tiny
python verify_perplexity.py --baseline --device mps 

# Check for dataset overlap between train and validation
python verify_perplexity.py --overlap
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes, you should see:

1. **Dataset size**: Approximately half as many samples per epoch
2. **Step count**: ~230K steps per epoch instead of ~460K
3. **Perplexity**: Higher, more realistic perplexity values (likely in the 30-60 range for the current model size)
4. **Baseline comparison**: Similar performance to a GPT-2 Tiny model of comparable size

## Running a Fixed Training Job

To run a training job with the fixed implementation:

```bash
# Run the fixed training script
./run_wikitext103_training.sh
```

This will output to a new directory `wikitext103_signalllm_fixed` to avoid confusing new results with old ones.

## Future Work

While the frequency domain approach in SignalLLM remains promising for computational efficiency, properly evaluating its performance requires:

1. Consistent evaluation methodology
2. Multiple datasets for testing generalization
3. Appropriate baselines for comparison
4. Careful hyperparameter tuning

The fixes implemented here provide a foundation for reliable evaluation of SignalLLM's true capabilities.
