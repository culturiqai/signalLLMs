# Known Issues and Contribution Opportunities

This document outlines current issues and areas for improvement in the SignalLLM project. These will be converted to GitHub issues to facilitate community contributions.

## Core Implementation Issues

### 1. HRFEvo Tensor Dimension Issues

**Description:** The Hierarchical Representation Function Evolution (HRFEvo) component currently has tensor dimension mismatches when optimizing basis functions across different batch sizes and sequence lengths.

**Technical Details:**
- In `signalllm_hrfevo_poc.py`, line ~1734, the evolved basis functions need to be reshaped to match the dimensions of input tensors.
- Currently, evolved functions trained on one batch size may cause dimension errors when applied to different batch sizes.
- The issue appears in the `update_basis_function` method of the `SignalLLM` class.

**Skills Needed:** PyTorch tensor manipulation, evolutionary algorithms

**Difficulty:** Medium

### 2. Wavelet Transform Edge Cases

**Description:** The wavelet transform implementation can produce artifacts at sequence boundaries, especially for shorter sequences.

**Technical Details:**
- In `signalllm_hrfevo_poc.py`, the `WaveletTransform` class needs improved boundary handling.
- Consider implementing additional padding modes or custom boundary handling specific to language sequences.

**Skills Needed:** Signal processing, wavelets, PyTorch
