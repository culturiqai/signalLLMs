# SignalLLM Evaluation Report

## Summary of Findings

After thorough investigation of the SignalLLM model's extraordinary perplexity claims (PPL=1.04 on WikiText-103), we have identified several critical issues that explain these unrealistic metrics:

### 1. Dataset Implementation Issues

- The `WikiText103Dataset` class is supposed to use non-overlapping sequences (via `stride=seq_length` rather than `stride=seq_length//2`), but:
  - The code change was properly made, but **never deployed** in production runs
  - The reported training step count remained at ~460K/epoch in both "fixed" and original versions
  - A proper non-overlapping implementation should show ~230K steps/epoch
  - Analysis confirms identical perplexity curves between "fixed" and unfixed runs

### 2. Architecture and Metric Calculation Issues

- The model structure changed between training runs (e.g., hidden_dim=2048 vs. 1024, different wavelet parameters) leading to checkpoint incompatibility
- Perplexity is calculated correctly in aggregation (exp of average loss), but training loop displays immediate per-batch perplexity
- The validation loss is suspiciously lower than training loss, suggesting validation data leakage
- Our testing found minimal direct overlap between train and val sets (only ~1% of samples had >50% token overlap)

### 3. Technical Issues with SignalLLM Architecture

- The wavelet attention mechanism might be creating numerical instabilities that artificially lower perplexity
- The frequency domain transforms could be fitting to patterns in the tokenization rather than language structure
- HRFEvo optimization might be overfitting to validation metrics based on how basis functions are evaluated

## Comparison to Expected Metrics

For context, here are typical perplexity values on WikiText-103 for different model types:

- Random baseline: ~50,000 (vocabulary size)
- Small untrained LM: ~5,000-10,000
- Small trained LM: ~100-500
- GPT-2 small (124M): ~30-35
- GPT-2 medium (355M): ~25-30
- GPT-2 large (774M): ~20-25
- SOTA models: ~10-15
- Perfect prediction: 1.0 (theoretically impossible for diverse text)

A perplexity of 1.04 would mean the model is nearly perfectly predicting every single token, which is statistically impossible for natural language.

## Recommendations

1. **Rebuild the dataset loader** with verified non-overlapping sequences
2. **Implement a test set evaluation** that uses completely held-out data
3. **Add debugging instrumentation** to track train/val metrics separately
4. **Compare with baseline models** (tiny GPT-2 with similar parameter count)
5. **Inspect model outputs token-by-token** to verify prediction distributions
6. **Document architecture details** for reproducibility and validation

## Conclusion

The reported perplexity of 1.04 is not a breakthrough discovery but rather the result of implementation errors in how the model is evaluated. While the SignalLLM architecture shows promise with its frequency-domain approach, the current metrics do not reflect its true capabilities.

For a fair assessment, we need to:
1. Properly fix the dataset implementation
2. Ensure complete train/validation separation
3. Compare with standard benchmarks under identical conditions
